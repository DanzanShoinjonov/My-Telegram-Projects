# My-Telegram-Projects
Hello to those who are reading this!
It is October 9, 2022.
So, right now I don't know how to use Git.
But I will be learning.
Right now I'm studying for exams and I don't have much time to learn programming (only on weekends).
But I keep going and want to make a full-fledged Telegram bot that will be useful!
